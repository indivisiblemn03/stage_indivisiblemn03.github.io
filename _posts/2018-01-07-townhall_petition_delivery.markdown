REPRESENTATIVE PAULSEN HAS NOT MET WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS IN AN OPEN, PUBLIC TOWN HALL MEETING SINCE 2011!
Early in 2017, concerned constituent members of Indivisible MN03 delivered a petition to the Representative’s district office with 1868 signatures requesting him to hold public Town Hall Meetings (Petitions Ask Rep. Erik Paulsen to Host In-Person Town Hall Meetings).


A group of constituents subsequently scheduled and organized a town hall meeting and invited Representative Paulsen to attend. He declined (Scenes from the ‘With or Without’ Erik Paulsen Town Hall).

It has been over six years since his last town hall meeting.
